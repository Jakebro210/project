#project used nano "task.sh" to edit all the files

#Hello World Bash Shell Script: Created a file and output what was in the ""

#Back Bash Shell Script: Created a tar ball (my user directory wasnt working so I used ./ instead)

#Variables: Create a file with an echo command that outputs several variables, then after the backup.sh was editied 2 more times to output details and removing a message

#Input, Output, and Error Redirections: Edited the backup.sh and added a new line to redirect the message to somewhere else (removing it)

#Functions: edited the backup.sh to include new function that show the number of files & directories

#Numeric and String Comparisons: used strings and numeric values to test if if text or numbers were equal where 0 means true and 1 means false

#Conditional Statements: created if_else.sh and made an if statement at first to test how it worked with num a and b and later added an else statment to see when num a is larger
#then edited the backup.sh again to add a if and else statement to see if the backup worked or failed and also some more echo statements to output more details

#Positional Parameters: created a small file to do as an example then edited backup.sh again to accept arguments to see if a directory exists

#For Loop: created a example file to print out the 3 numbers

#While Loop: created an example file to only keep executing when the number is less than 3 while the counter variable goes up by one

#Until Loop: creared an example file to have the counter variable start at a number and will keep going until the condition is true. then edited the backup.sh to implement the a loop to backup multiple directories if needed.
